//  BASIC THEORY
// AJAX: asynchronous javascript and XML
//HTTP request
// is a set of "web development techniques"
//  using many web technologies on the "client-side"
//  to create asynchronous web application

// with AJAX, web application can send and retrive
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
//  without interfering with display and behaviour of the ex]isting page

// we don't use data in XML format anymore
// we use JSON now

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1> XMLHttpRequest(old way of doing)
// 2. fetch api (new way of doing)
// 3. axios (this is third part library)
